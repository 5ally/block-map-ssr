This was WordPress v6.2.2 with Twenty Twenty-Three v1.1, and I used Firefox.

## Try the plugin (for quick testing)

You can download it [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/wzo59py7k0wllbw/block-map-ssr.zip?dl=0). It uses the *non-minified* build scripts, which you can also find in the [`build`](./build) folder in this repo.
